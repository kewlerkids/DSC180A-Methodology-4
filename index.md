## 1️⃣ What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
I found **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** most interesting because I got to apply models that connect to real-world data. It was cool to see how LLMs can analyze financial or behavioral information and be applied in real careers.

## 2️⃣ Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
For Quarter 2, I’d like to explore **financial behavior analysis** using Prism Data’s datasets. I want to compare models like **DistilBERT** and **other LLMs** to see which performs best in predicting consumer patterns. This could help improve how organizations interpret customer spending habits.

## 3️⃣ What potential change would you make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
I’d change how our data preprocessing works. Instead of using simple averages, I’d experiment with **different feature engineering methods** and **cross-validation** to make the results more consistent and reproducible.

---

## 4️⃣ What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I’d like to try **clustering** and **dimensionality-reduction** methods (like PCA) to uncover hidden patterns in the data. I’m also interested in **decision trees** and **random forests** for model interpretability.
